              <p>Steps to reevaluation is really important because you tend to forget that not only you are changing, but people and things around you are changing too. By reevaluating, you are anchoring yourself, taking note of what's going on around you and making sure that you are reacting and making decisions that are the best in terms of your current surroundings and not by how you judged the past. </p>

              <h1>Humaning!</h1>
              <p>We are not born to know how to human. Humaning is a very complicated yet simple task. All you have to do is breathe and you are human. Some people want to be “better” at humaning than others but where is the scale?</p>
              <h2>What is Human?</h2>
              <p>To human is the act of being alive. To be humane is to work with the ethics that people has built up over the years based on history. For example, the outcomes of war and evolution has taught us how to treat each other with respect. It is all quite commercial as well. </p>
              <h2>What is being a “good” Human?</h2>
              <p>Being a “good” human is being able to love one another, to be able to excel at work, to be able to have fun, to be happy, to be healthy, to have friends, to be interactive, charismatic, to have good education, to be ambitious and be successful, whilst praising those around you for supporting you and getting you to where you are today.</p>
              <p>Do you agree?</p>
              <p>Probably not. Because it is simple, to be a “good” Human, we all think fundamentally it is just to be nice to everyone. That’s it. But really though?</p>

              <h1>Inner Worlds</h1>
              <p>When you look at someone, we see the outer world, but a person can be divided into an inner world and outer world, which creates the full picture of the individual. </p>
              <p>This is probably what we conventionally refer to as the mental capacity of one’s mind.
              Some people have bigger inner worlds and other are the opposite. This doesn’t directly correlate to whether you are an introvert or extrovert, but it links to one’s conscious and subconscious. </p>
              <p> If your inner world is better than outer world, then you are usually acting on your subconscious; rather, if your outer world is larger in proportion to your inner world, then you are acting on your conscious which some people may refer to you as less of a dreamer, more as a realist. </p>
              <p>It is possible that you are able to self-assess the above.</p>
              <p>But this is not some test you can take. It takes time and years of self reflection.</p>
